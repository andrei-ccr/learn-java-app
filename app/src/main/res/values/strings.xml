		<p> To start learning, you'll first have to install Java. For beginners, an IDE is also recommended. This is what you'll do in this lesson: </p>

    <string name="lesson101_2"><![CDATA["
		<p> We'll start by downloading and installing Java. This tutorial applies for computers running <font color="green">Windows x64</font>. You'll download <font color="orange"><b>Java SE Development Kit 8</b></font>. </p>
		<p>
			<a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">1. Go to the Java download webpage</a><br>
			2. Select <font color="cyan">Accept License Agreement</font><br>
			3. Click on the filename <font color="green">jdk-8u191-windows-x64.exe</font> (click the red down arrow)<br>
			4. Run the downloaded executable and follow the onscreen instructions.<br>
		</p>
		
		<p>Java will now be installed on your computer. After it is done, you are theoretically ready to make Java programs.</p>
		<p>However, in the next section, you'll also learn how to download and install an IDE. An <b><font color="blue">Integrated Development Environment</font></b> is recommended for beginners. </p>

	<string name="lesson101_3"><![CDATA["
		<p>An <i>Integrated Development Environment</i> (IDE) is a software that makes writing programs easier. You get syntax highlighting, code <big>suggestions, your code is validated as you type and building and running your program is faster and easier. For beginners, these features are very helpful in the learning process.</p>

		<p>For <i>Java</i> development we are going to use <font color="orange"><b>Eclipse</b></font>. Eclipse is currently one of the most popular IDEs and possibly the most used one at the time of writing this.</p>

		<p>So let's download and install it. Remember, we are downloading the version for <font color="green">Windows x64</font>. Tap next to continue.</p>

	<string name="lesson101_4"><![CDATA["
		<p>First, go to the <a href="https://eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse download page</a>. You can access the download page by typing <font color="cyan"><i>eclipse.org/downloads</i></font> in your browser's bar.</p>

		<p>Look for the <font color="orange"><i>Download</i></font> button (it's a small orange button). Another page might open and you might have to click the <i>Download</i> button once again. After the setup file has finished downloading, run it.</p>

		<p>After a few seconds (it might take longer if your computer is slow) the EclipseInstaller window appears. Choose the <font color="purple"><big><b>Eclipse IDE for Java Developers</b></big></font>. Afterwards, you can click the <b>INSTALL</b> button.</p>
