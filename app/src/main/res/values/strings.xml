		<p>An <i>Integrated Development Environment</i> (IDE) is a software that makes writing programs easier. You get syntax highlighting, code suggestions, your code is validated as you type and building and running your program is faster and easier. For beginners, these features are very helpful in the learning process.</p><p>For <i>Java</i> development we are going to use <font color="orange"><b>Eclipse</b></font>. Eclipse is currently one of the most popular IDEs and possibly the most used one at the time of writing this.</p><p>So let's download and install it. Remember, we are downloading the version for <font color="green">Windows x64</font>. Tap next to continue.</p>

	<p>Let's start with the most basic program you can write: the <font bgcolor="green">Hello World</font> program. Create a new project with one class named <font color="#987654"><i>MyFirstApp</i></font>. Don't know how to do that? Check <a href="101_5">lesson 1 on how to create a project</a></p>
<p>You should now be able to write code inside the <font color="#987654"><em>MyFirstApp</em></font> class. Write the following code:</p>
<p>
<font color="#008000">public class</font> <font color="#1aa3ff"><em>MyFirstApp</em></font> { <br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println( <font color="#a300cc">"Hello World!"</font> ); <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}

	<string name="lesson_102_3_title">What does it do?</string>
	<string name="lesson102_3"><![CDATA["
		<p>Let's see what every line of code does:</p>
<p>The first line of code: <br><font color="#008000">public class</font> <font color="#1aa3ff"><em>MyFirstApp</em></font></p>
<p>This line declares a <font color="#008000">class</font> named <font color="#1aa3ff"><em>MyFirstApp</em></font> and makes it <font color="#008000">public</font>.</p>
<p>
What is a class and a public class? For now, that is not important. All programs in Java run inside a class so we'll have write them like this. You'll learn about what classes are in <a href="301">Chapter III</a>.</p>
	"]]></string>
	
	<string name="lesson_102_4_title">The main function</string>
	<string name="lesson102_4"><![CDATA["
<p>The second line of code was:<br>
<font color="#008000">public static</font> <font color="#B00040">void</font> <font color="#1aa3ff"><em>main</em></font>(<font color="black">String</font>[] <font color="#a300cc">args</font>)</p>

<p>This line declares a function named <font color="#1aa3ff">main</font>. It also declares this function as <font color="#008000">public</font>, <font color="#008000">static</font>, and <font color="#B00040">void</font>. Inside the parentheses, there's the function's parameter <font color="black">String</font>[] <font color="#a300cc">args</font>. You'll learn about the meaning of all these in <a href="108_1">Lesson 8</a>.</p>

<p>However, it's important to understand that every program starts inside this function. The function name is always <font color="#1aa3ff"><em>main</em></font> and has to be declared exactly like we did above. There can be ONLY ONE <font color="#1aa3ff"><em>main</em></font> function in every program and it is ALWAYS inside a class. When you execute the program, the code inside the <font color="#1aa3ff"><em>main</em></font> function will be executed.</p>

<p>If we don't write anything inside, nothing will happen.</p>

	<string name="lesson_102_5_title">Saying hello</string>
	<string name="lesson102_5"><![CDATA["
<p>The last line of code that needs explaining is this:<br>
System.out.println( <font color="#a300cc">"Hello World!"</font> ); <br>
</p>

<p>This line will output/print to the screen the words "Hello World!" (without the quote marks ").</p>

<p>We can print anything to screen using the command function:<br> System.out.println( <font color="#a300cc">"Your message here"</font> );</p>

<p><b>Note</b> the <b>;</b> at the end.</p> 

<p>You can print your own message to screen, or even print more messages by calling the printing function multiple times:<br>
System.out.println( <font color="#a300cc">"This is a message"</font> );<br>
System.out.println( <font color="#a300cc">"And this is another message"</font> );</p>

<p>Try it! Print your own messages to the screen. Remember that these must be written inside the <font color="#1aa3ff">main</font> function.</p>

<p>Java is a powerful language and there's more to it than just printing messages on the screen. In the next lesson, you are going to learn a very important concept: <font color="blue"><big>variables</big></font>.</p>
